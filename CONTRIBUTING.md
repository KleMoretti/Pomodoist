# Contributing

Open an issue before starting a substantial change. Keep pull requests focused
and include tests for behavior changes.

For Flutter UI, theme, and animation changes, follow the
[application design system](docs/design-system.md), including its shared
tokens, component boundaries, accessibility rules, and validation scope.

Before a pull request can be accepted, its author must read [CLA.md](CLA.md)
and check the CLA confirmation in the pull request template. Contributions
and official client binaries remain available under `AGPL-3.0-only`.

Run root `make check` for architecture boundaries, Flutter analysis and unit tests.
Direct Flutter commands run from `apps/flutter`. Keep dependencies directed as
described in the [repository architecture](docs/architecture/repository.md).
