# Cloud voice transcription

Linux, Windows, Android and **all browsers** record through `record` and submit
WAV audio to the authenticated `pomodoist-transcribe` Edge Function. Native iOS
and macOS use Apple Speech by default and can select cloud transcription in
Settings while signed in.
The existing recording/loading/retry UI, transcript analysis and task creation
remain the same, including the existing UI entitlement gate. The new backend
requires a signed-in account but does not add separate purchase verification;
local Apple speech does not acquire a new server dependency.

## Server configuration and deployment

Configure **only backend secrets/environment** (Supabase function secrets or
`server/.env` for the Docker stack). Never use Flutter `--dart-define`, the root
client environment template, web runtime config, or a client settings field for
these values.

| Variable | Default / purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `POMODOIST_OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Required server credential; transcription uses only this key. |
| `OPENROUTER_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL` | `openai/whisper-large-v3-turbo` |
| `VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION_PROVIDER` | `openrouter`; unsupported values fail closed. Future providers only need a server adapter, not voice UI changes. |
| `VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION_MAX_BYTES` | `12582912` (12 MiB decoded audio; configurable up to 25 MiB server-side). |
| `VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION_MAX_SECONDS` | `300` for actual PCM WAV samples; the application records at most five minutes. |
| `VOICE_TRANSCRIPTION_TIMEOUT_MS` | `55000` including response consumption; maximum 60000. |

Deploy `pomodoist-transcribe` together with the client. The Docker functions image
copies the function automatically; rebuild/recreate the functions service after
changing its code or environment. For hosted Supabase, deploy the new function
using `server/supabase/config.toml`. Its handler validates the bearer token with
Auth `getUser()` even though gateway `verify_jwt` is disabled for compatibility
with asymmetric JWTs. Missing/invalid sessions, anonymous users and missing
provider credentials cannot invoke OpenRouter. The server-only
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` reserves and settles usage through
`pomodoist_voice_quota`; it is never used to authenticate the caller or forwarded
to OpenRouter. Apply the `pomodoist_core_voice_quota` migration before deploying
the function. Protect provider spend with an OpenRouter key budget and
deployment-level rate limits in addition to the monthly application quota.

## Monthly quota

One unit is one successfully recognized audio recording, regardless of duration
or how many tasks the transcript contains. The existing definition in
`public.quota_definitions` controls the per-account monthly limit (currently
1,000 `voice_transcriptions`). All devices share the same counter. Native Apple
Speech does not use this cloud quota. Months start at 00:00 UTC on the first day;
the server determines the period and ignores client-supplied period boundaries.

`public.usage_periods` stores `used`, `limit_value`, `period_start`, and `period_end`
for each `user_id`, app, and quota. A new month's row is created on demand; previous
months remain available. The separate `llm_requests` counter allows 1,000 successful
text-to-task analyses per month, shared by normal and Smart mode and enforced by
both `pomodoist-ai` and the legacy `pomodoist-watch` route. Internal provider retries
use one reservation. Provider failures release it; settlement retries are idempotent.
Quota errors return `llm_quota_exceeded` (429) or `llm_quota_unavailable` (503).

Signed-in LLM callers use their verified Auth `user_id`. StoreKit-only callers use
`purchase_subject = apple:<environment>:<originalTransactionId>` derived from a
verified active purchase; their rows have no `user_id` and are hidden by ownership
RLS. These are separate account and purchase allowances. Neither counter records
tokens or dollar cost. Apply `pomodoist_llm_and_voice_quotas_1000` before deploying
the AI/Watch handlers; the service-role-only `pomodoist_llm_quota` RPC reuses the
same short-lived reservation table and cleanup job as transcription.

After validating the audio, the function reserves one slot before contacting the
provider. Concurrent requests cannot reserve beyond the remaining limit. A usable
transcript increments `usage_periods.used` exactly once for that server request;
provider errors release the slot. Abandoned reservations expire after ten minutes,
and a cron job removes expired request metadata. No audio or transcript is stored
in the reservation table. A response lost after successful processing can still
count; submitting the recording again starts a new request.

Monthly renewal does not depend on cron, an app restart, or a client clock.
A request reserved before midnight and completed afterward is charged to its
original month. Usage readers also run in UTC, regardless of the connection's
timezone.

An exhausted quota returns HTTP 429 with `code: voice_quota_exceeded`,
`retryable: false` and `resetsAt`. A quota database outage fails closed with HTTP
503 before provider work. The legacy `consume_quota` RPC cannot directly change
voice usage; other quota writes also use the server's UTC month.

Ensure any external reverse proxy allows at least **17 MiB JSON request bodies**
and a request timeout of at least **75 seconds**. The client uses the existing
account connection; no new public endpoint or model configuration is required.
Increasing only the server limit does not increase the current client's 12 MiB
upload bound or five-minute recording UI limit.

## Wire protocol and validation

The client sends JSON `{input_audio: {data: "<base64>", format: "wav"}, locale?}`
using `AccountClient.invokeFunction`. The server calls
`https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/audio/transcriptions` with JSON
`{model, input_audio, language?}` and the **server's** API key. Successful responses
are `{ok: true, text}`; failures are `{ok: false, code, error, retryable}`.
Client-supplied model, URL, API key and duration fields are not trusted.

Only PCM WAV uploads are accepted, including Apple's `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE`
headers with standard PCM/float subtype GUIDs. Their base64, container header and
actual sample duration are validated before any billed provider call. Compressed formats
(WebM, MP3, M4A/MP4, Ogg, FLAC and AAC) are rejected until their duration can be
verified server-side; byte limits alone cannot bound low-bitrate audio duration.
All current clients already record 16 kHz, mono PCM WAV without transcoding:
five minutes is approximately 9.6 MB before base64. Empty/malformed transcripts,
invalid audio, rate limits, provider errors, network failures and both header/body
timeouts return sanitized errors. Redirects are disabled for the credential-bearing
provider request. Audio, transcript text, tokens and provider response bodies are
never logged or included in error diagnostics.

## Local audio lifecycle and platform prerequisites

Native recordings and locale/account metadata are retained in the application
support directory until success, explicit close/discard, or recording again.
Failures can be retried without asking the microphone to re-record. Account
ownership is checked before uploads. Controller/overlay disposal aborts the local
attempt without discarding recoverable audio; a late provider response cannot
replace a newer attempt. HTTP cancellation is not exposed by `AccountClient`, so
in-flight server work may still finish or hit its timeout after local cancellation.

Browser retries retain independent audio bytes **only in the current page's
memory**, including across overlay/controller disposal. Reloading/closing the tab
loses that pending recording; audio is never written to browser localStorage.
Record in a secure context (HTTPS or localhost) and grant the site's microphone
permission. Browsers on Apple devices use this backend path as well. The production
CSP explicitly permits `blob:` in `connect-src` so recorded audio can be read before
the recorder revokes its object URL.

Linux requires the `record_linux` runtime tools: `parecord`, `pactl`, and `ffmpeg`
(for example, `pulseaudio-utils ffmpeg` on Debian/Ubuntu, or `libpulse ffmpeg` on
Arch). A compatible PulseAudio server or PipeWire PulseAudio compatibility layer
must be running. These are host dependencies, not newly bundled AppImage binaries.
Windows needs microphone access for desktop apps; its recovery button opens the
microphone privacy settings. Android already declares `RECORD_AUDIO`; permanent
permission denial can be recovered through the app's system settings. The adapter
does not request storage access or Apple Speech/Siri permissions on these platforms.

## Verification

```sh
deno test --allow-read --config server/supabase/deno.json server/supabase/functions/pomodoist-transcribe
flutter test test/backend_voice_test.dart test/voice_recording_store_test.dart test/quick_add_voice_test.dart
flutter test --platform chrome test/web/voice_recording_store_test.dart
flutter build web --debug
```

The server tests exercise the actual handler with an injected provider transport,
including a complete five-minute WAV, authentication, validation, configuration,
limits, sanitized errors and timeouts. Flutter tests cover transcript events,
permission denial, retry preservation, explicit/late cancellation, pending audio
restoration, account isolation, platform selection and the recording timer.
Browser storage tests verify survival after the recorder revokes its blob URL.

Before release, test real microphones on Linux/Windows/Android and Chrome/Firefox/
Safari over HTTPS: allow/deny permission, record a short phrase and a full five
minutes, stop, create a task, go offline and retry, close/discard while processing,
and verify both native and cloud recognition on iOS/macOS. Live OpenRouter calls require
an operator-supplied key and are not made by unit tests.
