# Windows EXE installer design

Date: 2026-08-17

## Goal

Provide an unsigned Windows distribution that a user can download as one
`Pomodoist-Setup.exe` file, open, and immediately use.

## Selected approach

Use Inno Setup to wrap the complete Flutter Windows release directory in one
per-user installer. A bare Flutter runner cannot be distributed as one file
because it depends on adjacent DLLs and the `data` directory.

The installer:

- supports Windows 10 build 19041 or newer;
- installs without elevation under `{localappdata}\Programs\Pomodoist`;
- uses the stable application ID `com.finchforge.pomodoist`;
- replaces application files during upgrades while preserving user data;
- registers `pomodoist://` under the current user's `Software\Classes` key;
- creates a current-user Start Menu shortcut and an uninstall entry;
- launches Pomodoist after a successful interactive installation;
- has no welcome, directory, program-group, ready, or finish pages;
- produces `build\flutter\windows\installer\Pomodoist-Setup.exe` and its SHA-256
  checksum.

The installer contains the x64 Flutter build. It runs natively on x64 Windows
10/11 and through Windows 11's x64 compatibility on Arm64.

## Release separation

Tag-triggered publication uploads the EXE and Linux AppImage to the same draft
GitHub release and publishes it only after both platforms and checksums exist.
Manual Windows workflow runs remain separate pre-releases. Release notes state
that the EXE is unsigned and may trigger Microsoft Defender SmartScreen.

Production Dart defines come only from the protected `windows-production`
GitHub Environment. Local release builds continue to require an explicit JSON
configuration file and embed the full Git commit SHA.

## Error handling

Packaging stops if the release executable, Flutter runtime, data directory,
icon, valid semantic version, or Inno Setup compiler is missing. Installation
replaces files atomically where Inno Setup supports it and refuses unsupported
Windows versions. Launch is attempted only after the files and registry entries
have been installed successfully.

## Verification

Automated checks validate the installer source and packaging script, including
identity, minimum OS, per-user path, protocol command quoting, output name,
silent pages, post-install launch, and checksum generation. CI builds the
Flutter release, compiles the installer, checks its Authenticode state and
hash, installs it silently, validates files and protocol registration, launches
the installed runner, uninstalls it, and uploads only the installer and
checksum.

Local verification builds the current x64 release, compiles the installer,
opens it normally, waits for the installed `pomodoist.exe` process, and leaves
the application running for manual inspection.

## Known limitation

SmartScreen may show an unknown-publisher warning. An unpackaged Flutter
application can display and schedule Windows notifications, but Windows does
not give it package identity; APIs that cancel already displayed notifications
or enumerate active notifications remain limited.
