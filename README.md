## Chinese personal fork

This fork is based on [Kabanya/Pomodoist](https://github.com/Kabanya/Pomodoist).
`chinese` is the development and release branch; `main` is reserved for upstream
synchronization and must not receive fork-specific changes. Create feature branches
from `chinese` and merge them back into `chinese`.

Download this fork's Windows installers from
[KleMoretti/Pomodoist Releases](https://github.com/KleMoretti/Pomodoist/releases).
To publish, run **Chinese Windows preview** on `chinese`. These unsigned preview
builds currently use local mode; cloud sign-in and sync are not configured.
Local features in this personal edition require no subscription. Purchase offers,
subscription settings, and store initialization are disabled. This does not grant
paid access to the upstream hosted services. The interface includes a bundled
Noto Sans SC font. Task focus buttons and the Focus screen share a setup dialog
for choosing a task, plan, and session round target.

Manual acceptance: check Chinese text in both windows; confirm there are no
purchase offers in onboarding or settings; start a task from Today with a custom
round count; choose a different task from Focus; cancel a switch and verify the
current timer survives. Original project information and attribution follow below.
