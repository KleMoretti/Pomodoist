# Desktop updates

Hosted Pomodoist builds may check public GitHub releases 10 seconds after
startup, every six hours, and on resume when their last check was more than an
hour ago. Automatic checks run in enabled release builds; Settings → About →
Updates also works in debug builds. Checks never download or execute an
installer until the user presses **Update**.

The Chinese personal edition does not consume the upstream `Kabanya/Pomodoist`
release feed. Its official-update flag is disabled for every environment, so it
does not offer or install an upstream binary through automatic or manual checks.
Until a fork-owned manifest, channel and compatibility-tested assets exist,
download Chinese preview/local builds through the repository's manual Windows
workflow. Self-hosted and local builds likewise do not check, download or install
official updates; self-hosted clients must be rebuilt by their operator to
preserve their server configuration.

Hosted production builds may re-enable the generic official-update path only
when they supply a compatible release source and policy explicitly.

## Channels and assets

Stable is the persistent default. The optional RC switch includes `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`
alongside stable releases. Drafts, alpha/beta tags, manual Windows preview tags,
and stable tags marked as prereleases are excluded. Version precedence is SemVer,
not publication date, string order or Flutter build number. Switching back to
stable never downgrades an installed newer RC.

All release pages are read, with a bounded request deadline. A release must have
an exact matching uploaded asset and SHA-256 metadata or checksum sidecar. The
existing release workflows already publish the required files:

| Process architecture | Windows | Linux |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x64 | `Pomodoist-Setup-x64.exe` or existing `Pomodoist-Setup.exe` | `Pomodoist-x86_64.AppImage` |
| arm64 | `Pomodoist-Setup-arm64.exe` | `Pomodoist-aarch64.AppImage` |

Only x64 assets are currently produced. The updater never mislabels an x64 asset
as native arm64. An x64 process under Windows ARM emulation requests the x64
installer. Native arm64 builds need the explicit arm64 release assets above.

Linux in-place updates apply to the official writable AppImage distribution.
Non-AppImage packages stay under their package manager's control. macOS, iOS,
Android and web do not instantiate a native updater. Existing releases without
this code need one initial installation of an updater-enabled build; the feature
cannot be retroactively added to their running binaries.

## UI and data

The compact bottom-right card shows the version, release notes, **×** and
**Update**. Tags are persisted before their first notification; closing or
restarting does not repeat automatic prompts for that tag. Manual checks can
reopen a dismissed offer. English and Russian copy, light/dark themes, constrained
windows, progress animation, keyboard-accessible controls and reduced motion are
supported. Closing a busy popup hides it but does not stop a requested update.

Downloads use a dedicated client without application account credentials. Failed
automatic checks remain in Settings rather than interrupting work. Manual checks
show an actionable error. Channel changes and duplicate update requests are
blocked while an operation is active.

## Installation and recovery

Downloads stream into a private same-volume staging directory. The declared byte
count and SHA-256 must match; a sidecar must name the exact artifact and agree
with the GitHub digest when both exist. Only HTTPS GitHub release URLs and its
allowlisted download CDNs are accepted. Partial files are never executed.
SHA-256 over GitHub HTTPS detects corruption; it is not independent publisher
signing. The current Windows installer remains unsigned and Windows policy may
block it. No signature verification is claimed.

A bundled helper rechecks the hash, takes an installation lock and acknowledges
readiness before Flutter asks its application exit observers for consent. Once
they agree and the updater is still active, it requests a required native exit.
This avoids treating Windows' provisional `cancel` response to a native cancelable
request as a user veto. An actual veto or disposal while awaiting consent cancels
the helper and leaves the application running.
It never kills another running Pomodoist instance to force an update. Cancellation
or timeout leaves the current executable unchanged.

Linux backs up the original AppImage and atomically renames the verified image
on the same filesystem. Windows backs up the installation directory, runs the
existing per-user Inno installer with the **current** `/DIR`, disables forced
application closure and system reboot, then restarts Pomodoist. It restores the
old directory if installation or launch fails. Neither helper writes to the
application database, preferences, account tokens or application-data directories.

The new Flutter window acknowledges startup through a restricted marker. The
helper restores and relaunches the prior build if no marker arrives. This is a
window/engine health check, not a guarantee that every future database migration
is reversible. Failed staging directories retain `error.log`/`startup.log`, the
installer log and any recovery copy; successful staging is removed by the new
process. A restored build reports the failed update in Settings.

Updater preferences initialize only when used. The existing channel and seen-tag
keys and storage API are unchanged; no preferences or application data migration
is needed.

On abrupt OS power loss, the Linux target is either the old or new complete file;
Windows relies on Inno Setup's installation recovery and the retained `previous`
backup. Do not delete a failed staging directory until recovery is confirmed.

## Verification

Run the pinned SDK through `.fvm/flutter_sdk/bin/flutter`: `analyze`, `test`,
`test --platform chrome test/web/voice_recording_store_test.dart` and
`build web --debug` for the shared code and conditional-import boundary.
Focused tests are named
`test/desktop_update_*_test.dart`.

Run `python3 -m unittest tool/test_desktop_update_helpers.py` on Linux and
`powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tool/test_desktop_update_windows.ps1`
on Windows. They execute the exact embedded helper scripts against isolated
fixture executables, including corrupt hashes, cancellation and rollback.
The `Desktop updater` PR workflow also compiles both native desktop targets.
It does not publish releases, install into a user's profile or use production secrets.

Before publishing a stable updater release, smoke-test an update between two
consecutive RC builds on Windows 10/11 and an AppImage desktop session: preserve
a task, settings and login across an update, cancel graceful exit, test a read-only
target, corrupt download and network failure, and confirm stable/RC behavior and
unsigned-installer policy.
Fixture/CI tests do not substitute for that real-device release acceptance pass.
Record code fixes, automated checks and real upgrade results separately; keep
the real-upgrade acceptance criteria in issue #58 open until that pass succeeds.
